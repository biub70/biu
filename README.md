1. Supply and demand
Supply: The total amount of Bitcoin is fixed at 21 million, and this fixed supply is the basic factor of its value. However, the impact of supply on price is more reflected in the context of demand changes. For example, when demand suddenly increases and supply remains unchanged, prices will rise; otherwise, they will fall.
Demand
Investor cognition and willingness to buy: As more and more people recognize the value of Bitcoin and are willing to buy and hold Bitcoin, demand increases and prices rise; on the contrary, if investors lose confidence in its value and demand decreases, prices will fall.
Market heat: For example, in April 2023, the market's enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies declined, and the demand for Bitcoin decreased, leading to a drop in prices.
2. Policy factors
Differences in policies in different countries
In some countries, such as the United States and Japan, policies are relatively loose, which has played a positive role in promoting the development of the Bitcoin market; while in my country, an announcement was issued in September 2017 to explicitly prohibit the trading of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and the price of Bitcoin fell as soon as the news came out.
In 2022, China stepped up its crackdown on cryptocurrencies, and the price of Bitcoin fell sharply in the short term; governments around the world continued to tighten their regulatory policies on cryptocurrencies, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) increasing its supervision of cryptocurrency exchanges, which increased market uncertainty, led to rising market panic, and thus affected the price of Bitcoin.
3. Market sentiment
Investor sentiment spread: In the Bitcoin market, investor sentiment often affects price fluctuations. When the market is generally optimistic about Bitcoin, prices rise; when the market panics and investors sell off, prices fall. This sentiment spreads very quickly and often causes sharp price fluctuations in a short period of time. For example, a market panic in March 2023 caused the price of Bitcoin to fall by more than 10% in one day.
Confidence is tested: When investors' confidence in the cryptocurrency market is tested, it will cause market sentiment to fluctuate, which in turn affects the price of Bitcoin. For example, the price of Bitcoin has fallen by about 30% from its high in early 2023, partly due to frustrated investor confidence.
4. Technical innovation
Bitcoin's own technical problems: Bitcoin network's technical problems, such as transaction congestion and rising fees, will affect investors' confidence in Bitcoin. According to BitInfoCharts data, the price may be affected when the average transaction fee of the Bitcoin network has risen by about 50% recently.
Impact of related technical competition
Bitcoin's fork event. In August 2017, Bitcoin had a hard fork, resulting in Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The forked Bitcoin Cash has affected the price of Bitcoin to a certain extent.
The rise of other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and EOS, has also distracted investors from Bitcoin to a certain extent, affecting its price.
5. Security
Hacker attacks: Due to the anonymity of transactions of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, they have become the main target of hacker attacks. Historically, there have been many exchanges that have been hacked, resulting in the theft of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Whenever such incidents occur, the price of Bitcoin will be affected. For example, in 2018, Coincheck, one of Japan's largest Bitcoin exchanges, was hacked, resulting in the theft of cryptocurrencies worth $530 million. This incident had a negative impact on the price of Bitcoin.
6. International Situation
Safe-haven demand: Against the backdrop of increasing global economic uncertainty, Bitcoin is seen as a safe-haven asset. In 2018, the Turkish lira depreciated, and investors transferred funds to the Bitcoin market to seek value preservation. Such events often lead to an increase in Bitcoin prices.
7. Industrial Chain Development
Application Scenario Expansion: With the continuous improvement of the Bitcoin industry chain, more and more application scenarios have emerged, such as Bitcoin payments and Bitcoin loans. The implementation of these application scenarios will help improve the market recognition of Bitcoin, thereby driving up prices.
8. Speculation
Short-term operation impact: In the Bitcoin market, speculation is ubiquitous. Some investors try to profit from price fluctuations through short-term operations. This speculative behavior has exacerbated Bitcoin price fluctuations to a certain extent.
9. Financial Market Linkage
Other Market Fluctuation Transmission: The linkage between Bitcoin and other financial markets is gradually increasing. Fluctuations in gold, stock markets, foreign exchange and other markets may affect Bitcoin prices.
10. Media and social aspects
Influence of media reports: Media reports on Bitcoin will also affect market sentiment. Some positive reports may increase investor confidence and drive prices up; while negative reports may cause market panic and price drops.
Influence of social media: The views of opinion leaders on Bitcoin on social media will also affect market fluctuations. Some well-known investors or entrepreneurs publicly express their optimism about Bitcoin, which may trigger market follow-up.
